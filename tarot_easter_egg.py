dict ={1: {'Love': u"The meaning of The Fool in the context of love could indicate that you aren't ready for a commitment. At least not yet. Even though others may be pressing you for one now is not the time.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having fun and indeed this card is a positive harbinger for your love life; lots of fun seems to be in the offing and this is what you want right now in an existing relationship.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for a new relationship and hopefully love then make sure you don't let your desire for fun let you overlook the real thing should it come your way now. When you're wrapped up in having fun it can be easy to overlook the possibilities in a new relationship. True love is not always instant so you need to make sure you're aware that it could be creeping up on you!\n", 'Name': u'The Fool', 'General': u"The Fool is always an indicator of newness in one form or another. In many ways it indicates the purity, the open-hearted energy, and the innocence of a child. Children are trusting and trust forms the basis of meaning for this card.\n\nThis is generally considered a positive card but there is a caveat. The caveat being that it is important to take time to be sure that you are looking where you're going. Trusting yourself to take a step into the unknown is one thing, but doing so without any thought whatsoever may be a mistake.\n\n \nIn general, this card would indicate new beginnings that have some deeper spiritual meaning. Spiritual in the sense that is meaningful in terms of your inner self.\n\nBeing religious and being spiritual are not the same thing. It does not mean religious here; you can be spiritual without being in the least bit religious. For example, starting a new relationship would be considered meaningful and hence spiritual. Buying a new pair of shoes would not!\n\nThe appearance of the Fool can depict an important fresh start in almost any aspect of your life. Life is cyclical and you will experience fresh starts many times as you grow spiritually. The Fool means another new journey is about to begin.\n\n", 'Spirituality': u"It's possible that you'll be slightly accident prone when the Fool is appearing; be present in the moment and don't take silly chances. It's amazing how many pitfalls can be avoided with a little common sense so don't get carried away and take avoidable risks.\n\nOverall, though, when this card appears your health is very likely to be on the upswing. If you're having health problems, you are very likely to find the people and items you need to make headway toward a full recovery. Mind over matter can be very helpful; positive thought is important and should come fairly easily to you now.\n", 'Health': u"Other people may not understand or support your new ideas and/or proposals, but if you know that you're right, press ahead, and try to help them to understand where you are coming from. Do make sure that you are right though and that you are being stubborn for all the right reasons.\n\nThe Fool can sometimes indicate finding a new position. This could be within your existing job and might even mean a promotion. If, however, you are not satisfied with your current lot it can mean that now is the time to look for a new job that suits you better.\n\nIt can also mean that the time could be right for you to go off on your own and start your own business. That's a scary prospect for most people but if it's something that you've been idly considering then the Fool means you should be giving it serious consideration.\n", 'Finances': u"When this card appears, you are likely to be in or nearing a period of experimentation. You may well have a desire to try out lots of different approaches to spirituality to see how they fit for you personally.\nThere is nothing wrong with this exploration of possibilities, just make sure you don't get too carried away in any one thing while you are 'just shopping.' There are many possibilities out there and you will find the one that is right for you.\nIf you are not yet exploring spiritual possibilities then this card can indicate a powerful need to gain a deeper knowledge of spirituality. Your friends and family may not understand where this is coming from. Regardless of their attitude you have to do what is best for you.\n", 'ID': 1}, 2: {'Love': u"If you are in the market for a new romance, this is a time when you are likely to meet someone new. Right now someone out there somewhere is looking for you just as you are looking for them.\n\nWhether they find you or not will depend on you. Don't sit at home expecting Mr/Miss Right to walk up your garden path and knock on the door because they probably won't. You need to be out there making yourself available to be found and this is an excellent time to do just that. Get out there and meet people.\n\nIf you're in a long-term relationship already then the relationship will very likely rise to new and deeper levels of commitment and enjoyment. Even if nothing very concrete seems to have changed when you think about it objectively your perception of it will.", 'Name': u'The Magician', 'General': u"The Magician is about making higher and better use of all of one's power. Spiritual, emotional, and otherwise. This is another card that often signifies new beginnings and great expectations.\n\nThis is a very powerful, positive omen in a reading. This card reminds us that we have the power to make a difference, in our lives and in the greater world, if we simply make a point to try.\n\nYou should note that this is not magic in the sense that you need to do spell-work or anything of that nature. It's also not 'magic' like a stage illusionist performs, which is the somewhat superficial appearance of wondrous feats.\n\nThis is actual transformation of the literal and figurative world in normal ways. You are not going to have it all handed to you on a plate, but you have the potential to have that plate and a lot of what's on it if you do the magic yourself.\n\nThe Magician is all about action. If you do nothing you'll get nothing. If you don't know what to do then just do something because anything is better than nothing. In other words if you don't try you won't get.\n\nYou may notice many synchronicities, which point towards deep, spiritual events taking place regardless of the importance of their superficial appearances. You should be finding that you have the knowledge, strength, and inspiration needed to meet your challenges. In general this is a very positive time for you.\n\nIt is important to note though that to make the very most of this time you will need to do your part. Even though the Magician is a very positive card it is all about potential.", 'Spirituality': u"If you've been feeling ill, that will most likely end soon; this card signifies strength and/or the return of strength. If you do have some kind of ongoing health issue that hasn't gotten better, you may benefit greatly from undertaking some sort of additional alternative therapy such as nutritional counseling, massage, dietary restriction, and so forth.", 'Health': u"There will be an improvement in your work/career life. Particularly if your work is in a creative field this is a time when your suggestions and work will be met with appreciation and may lead to bigger and better things.\n\nBigger and better things are definitely a possibility. A promotion may be on the horizon but even if it isn't a pay rise might be. Whichever is the case this is a time to sound your own trumpet and ask. As the saying goes... 'If you don't ask you don't get!'\n\nIf you are out of work or thinking about changing jobs this is an auspicious time to do so. Even if you think you've exhausted all the possibilities you haven't so if necessary go back and repeat all the steps you have already taken and try again.", 'Finances': u"This is an excellent time for you to undertake some form of spiritual study that you've thought about in the past but haven't had the opportunity to pursue. You would also benefit from discussion groups that are spiritual in origin.\n\nA spiritual teacher may appear in your life now. This person will be an excellent mentor and will help you to have a new lease on life.", 'ID': 2}, 3: {'Love': u"\nThis can be a magical, mystical time for love for anyone interested in love. If you are a woman, you may well find people literally throwing themselves at you. The problem is that you will attract both the good and the bad and it's not always easy to tell which is which!\n\nYou have the power of femininity at your disposal at this moment in time and at first glance that may seem great, but there is a caveat. Don't abuse that power or it may backfire on you. Use it wisely - it's potent!\n\nIf you date women, you could well be interested in a woman who is distant and unapproachable and it may be that that is the way she will stay. Trust your instincts to let you know when you are chasing the unattainable.\n", 'Name': u'The High Priestess', 'General': u"The High Priestess is a very spiritual card - often with sexual overtones. It can mean that you are in a phase where you are going to be much more physically attractive to others.\n\nShe is tied to the moon, to femininity, and to inspiration.\n\nThis is a time to rely on your intuition and your inner knowledge, rather than your conscious mind or intellect. It is also important that you pay attention to your dreams right now. Keeping s dream diary or journal would be a good idea.\n\nSynchronicities are likely to surface in your life at this time When the High Priestess appears in a man's reading, she also often represents a woman that he will want badly; but whom he may not be able to get.\n", 'Spirituality': u"There may be information about your health that has not yet come to light. If you feel that something is amiss with your body, believe in your concerns and advocate for yourself. Don't be fobbed off by the medical system and if your doctor isn't helpful then you may need to see a different health care practitioner.\n\nTrust yourself. If a procedure or test that is suggested to you doesn't feel right then discuss it with your doctor. Don't feel that you have to go through with it just because it's suggested. As the television commercials are so fond of saying: 'Ask your doctor if ABC is tight for you.'\n\nBe sure that you are supporting yourself as best you can with diet, exercise, and vitamins/minerals.\n", 'Health': u"\nIt's possible that a pleasant surprise will be coming your way soon in regard to work. Although this could be a pay rise it is much more likely to take a different form. It could simply be something that makes your life easier. You may come up with some new systems or processes that make your work life simpler and less stressful.\n\nIf you are in the process of (or even just thinking about) changing jobs then this is an auspicious time to keep your eyes and ears open for something new.\n\nIf neither of those scenarios seem to fit then it is possible that there is a lot of workplace gossip going on. Ignore it and certainly don't get involved in it. Not always easy to do of course as it is human nature to gossip but stay away if you can.\n", 'Finances': u"\nMessages can come to you from all sorts of places. Make a point to look at spirituality in ways that you have not done before. That doesn't mean that you need to attend different religious services or if you don't currently attend any that you need to start.\n\nSo many people confuse being religious with being spiritual. They are often completely different things. Although they can be one and the same do not assume that they are.\n\nTalk to people whose experiences and beliefs are different than your own. Make the effort to move out of your comfort zone. You'll be all the richer for it.\n", 'ID': 3}, 4: {'Love': u"This is a very potent time for love and you may find that men and women alike are suddenly finding you far more attractive (both in terms of friendship and romance) and you will want to be careful with how you use this power. Don't underestimate its potency.\n\nIf you are single and are looking then this is a time when love, true love that is, could very well come your way. In fact if you are single and NOT looking then true love may seek you out anyway.\n\nCommitted relationships often become sweeter, deeper, and truer under the influence of the Empress. There will be, however, a tendency to get a little carried away with the emotional side of things. The Empress loves the emotional side of life - it's where she's coming from - but there needs to be some balance. Don't let yourself get too carried away!\n", 'Name': u'The Empress', 'General': u"\nThe Empress is an archetype of feminine power; she is watery, hard to fathom, mysterious, fertile, and sexual. She augurs a need for us to be in touch with our feminine side, to listen to our intuition, and to give priority to our emotions and passions.\n\nThe Empress does not play by the rules. She has her own way of doing things and her own idea of what is right and what is wrong in any and all endeavors. That doesn't mean she will always get her way, but she is a reminder not to ignore your creative and intuitive side.\n\nShe can signify coming abundance but don't make the mistake of thinking that that will always mean financially. There are many types of wealth and richness in life and money is only one of them. The Empress can encompass any or all of them.\nPeople are going to be more attracted to you than usual (in every sense) and you are likely to find people on your doorstep, wanting your advice/your shoulder to cry on.\n\nThis will be beneficial to you because you are now going to be able to see yourself more in the way that others see you; as someone with wisdom and a lot to offer.\n\nSo share your hard-won perspectives on life with others and know that your wisdom and caring is valuable. That doesn't mean you should run yourself into the ground doing so. If boundaries need to be drawn (for either physical or emotional reasons) then draw them.\n", 'Spirituality': u"If you're trying to get pregnant then this is an excellent sign that this may be forthcoming. If you're not ready to be a parent and pregnancy is a possibility for you then this is a time when you want to be triply careful.\n\nIf you're having health issues of any kind, ponder them from a different point of view; what is your body trying to tell you? Consider adding some sort of naturopathic or homeopathic approach to your health regime.\n", 'Health': u"Things should be going very well for you at work right now, but if they're not then this card indicates that things will get better. Things may not be perfect when they do but they will be significantly better.\n\nPeople will be inspired by your ideas, your passions, and your way of doing things. Let your inner voice guide you in how you operate. The empress directs us to follow our bliss, and that the rest will follow.\n\nIn this analytical day and age where everything seems to be quantified down to the nth degree most companies reward left-brain thinking and ignore the creative right-brain side of things. As with most endeavors there should be balance and that is also what the Empress is all about. Without creativity so much becomes merely mundane.\n", 'Finances': u"Your intuition may well be trying to send you a message during this time. It will be important to listen closely to it now and if that requires that you take time alone then do so. All those who normally call on your time and energy will have to wait for a little while. Making time alone needs to be a priority.\n\nHeed any messages or warnings that seem to come to you now through your inner voice. Don't panic though! It doesn't mean that something bad will definitely happen, but simply that it will be something you should act upon. That could be to your benefit rather than detriment just as easily.\n", 'ID': 4}, 5: {'Love': u'You may find yourself falling for someone who is older than you now. This person is likely to be attracted to order, logic, and organization. The attraction may not be mutual from the very beginning, but if you are patient and persistent, it is likely to grow.\n\nRemember that fireworks at the beginning are all well and good, but ask yourself how long fireworks last for in life. A slow-burning connection is likely to far outlast the fireworks.\n', 'Name': u'The Emperor', 'General': u"\nThe appearance of The Emperor shows us that domination of the mind over the heart is sometimes necessary even though it is not wanted. In fact he should be welcomed and that is what you must think about when he appears.\n\nWhen hard choices must be made it's important to maintain your concentration and focus. The Emperor signals this but he also signals that now is a time you should find it easier to make hard choices.\n\nEnjoy the assertiveness and confidence that this self-control and focus brings. Forge ahead and do what you know is best. If you can master yourself then you should have little problem mastering most of the other obstacles that life throws at you.\nIt looks as though a kind, older man may be part of your scenario. This could be a work colleague, or your father or a father-type figure. Perhaps he will be interested in you romantically. If so, don't rule him out, just because of his age.\n\nYou may feel that this man rules with an iron fist and that he can be frustrating at times. Despite that he is trying to help you to see that rules have their place and their reasons, and you will come out all the better for it.\n\nAbove all else, this man teaches - without even trying, perhaps - the benefits of structure and logic ruling over the emotions and lesser desires.\n", 'Spirituality': u'Believe in your right to good health and be logical about what you are doing to your body. Order and discipline may be helpful. For example, if you are struggling with a health issue, write down your symptoms, track them, and then see if anything in your life corresponds with your systems. Consider an elimination diet to check for food intolerances.\n', 'Health': u'Work should be going well and your efforts will not be going unnoticed. Pay particular attention to organization, follow-through, and logic. Your results should be stellar and if not stellar at least much better than they were.\n\nIf you are looking for work, now is a time to be dispassionate and to step outside yourself and think about how others see you from a logical point of view. Explore the logical reasons why they should hire you and then stress them to others. You are likely to be successful in finding work if you make a logical and sustained effort now.\n', 'Finances': u"Be sure to take time out for yourself in order to honor your need for spiritual growth. Do not focus totally on your left-brained aspects (logic, reason, order), but allow your right brain to have input too.\n\nLogic can lead you to the spirit, if you allow this, and if you don't get too stuck in your logical self. Meditation, which requires great disciplinefor most people, will come easier to you now if you make the time and take the effort to try.\n\n", 'ID': 5}, 6: {'Love': u'Romance also is likely to be going very well, although in a pretty traditional way (i.e. these energies will work best for you if you can conduct yourself in whatever way someone in your shoes is "expected" to be. Now is not the time to "buck the system" or to be unconventional any more than you have to be.', 'Name': u'The Hierophant', 'General': u' This is also a card that is very much about spirituality - everything from traditional religion to earth-centered spirituality and any other spiritual notion that you can conceive of. There may be a tension between your idea of spirituality and the "right thing" and the ideas of others around you. Stand up for your own beliefs. The "rules" and the "system" of doing things are probably playing a major role now. Rituals of any sort will be helpful to you now, even if it\'s just "a movie with friends every third Saturday."', 'Spirituality': u' Ritual of any kind is helpful to you now. If you have health challenges, discipline, order, and commitment - in whatever way that makes sense to you - is the way to go about it.

This is a good time to get involved with groups even if you don\'t think of yourself as a "group person," as you will find that you have much to learn from them (in a very positive way.) Work should be going very well provided you are able to be organized and work within the rules.', 'Finances': u' You are very much concerned with spirituality now (even if you don\'t have anything approximating a "traditional" religious belief. Make regular time, even if you don\'t attend a "traditional" house of worship - to quiet yourself and allow your spirit some time to expand. What matters here is the regularity of it - whether it\'s daily, weekly; whatever you can make time for. You will see changes in your life and outlook as a result of giving yourself this time.', 'ID': 6}, 7: {'Love': u' When this card appears, it usually means this time is likely to bring LOVE in capital letters to the center stage of your life. This is either a new relationship, or a powerful re-bonding of an old one. Either way you will be quite happy about how romance is going and others will likely remark that you are "glowing." This is serious stuff. It could mean, even in a new relationship, where you are meeting each other\'s families and talking about "forever." Again, share your joy with those around you who need it. Life will feel blissful to you now, which is wonderful.', 'Name': u'The Lovers', 'General': u' It\'s possible when this card appears that you are feeling ambivalent about a relationship or situation in your life. It could be that your heart is telling you one thing, and your head, another. In general, the thing to do is (within the bounds of your morality) to follow your heart. Some people say there are only two modes that any of us are operating under at any time; and that\'s "fear" or "love." When you can: choose love.

However, don\'t blindly follow; question everything, listen to your heart and your gut reactions; take what is offered that is helpful to you, and disregard the rest. A mentor may be getting ready to come into your life.

Either way, communicate as best you can about your boundaries and preferences and be honest with yourself about the possibilities. \nIf you aren't interested in a relationship with someone who clearly wants one with you then the kindest thing you can possibly do is to let them know that you just aren't interested. The short term angst this may cause will benefit everyone in the long run. \n", 'Name': u'The Chariot', 'General': u"\nThe Chariot indicates a lot of energy but not free-for-all energy. It's directed, controlled, and has a goal in mind. When this card appears you are likely to be fairly clear on what your hopes and dreams involve and what you are willing to do to make them come true. \nIn general this card points to determination and ambition. It's about getting things done, and testing and proving that you've got what it takes. \nThis is a sign that you should move forward with whatever you have in mind (and in your heart) and give it your best shot. Remember, though, that you'll need to use both your intellect and your heart, in order to be truly successful. \n", 'Spirituality': u"\nOn the whole your vitality is very strong now and you should have quite a lot of 'get up and go.'

To be truly strong, you must pay attention to and develop each leg of the triad we are made from: body, mind, and spirit. Be sure you are spending time on all three.

Even if it\'s just a five minute walk around the house so that you can clear your head. This is also very much a card about "trying very hard to do the right thing." Just make sure that "doing the right thing" includes doing what is right for you personally, and not just worrying about the wants and needs of others. ', 'Spirituality': u' Ritual of any sort will be helpful to you health-wise. (this could even be something like reading a book for an hour every Saturday afternoon).

In most cases, this indicates positive, needed changes but for some people, change itself is very difficult and can almost be traumatic. This is a very spiritual and karmically oriented time. Change is part of the cyclical nature of life. ', 'Spirituality': u'Resisting change can be bad for your health. Do whatever it takes to keep your stress level under control. When in doubt, go back to the basics; proper nutrition, proper rest and proper exercise go a long way toward helping. Meditation and Yoga may help keep you in top-shape also.

It is rare for things to "just happen" or for us to be a truly blameless "victim" in a situation.

On the other hand, if you are single, this is a time when commitment may be coming your way very shortly.  Stay clear about what you most want from relationships, and you are likely to "find it" that much sooner.

', 'Spirituality': u' It\'s important to "stay in the moment" and, once again, to pay attention to how you are (or are not) keeping a sense of balance in your life. Moderation is not just for monks, it\'s an important part of living a sensible and healthy life.

You might be very pleasantly surprised by how things work out. The only caveat with the reversal is that you should be a little careful as to make sure you\u2019re not over-estimating the strength of a love relationship; e.g. don\u2019t push the boundaries too hard or you could end up unpleasantly surprised.

This is a great time to correct bad habits if you need to do so in order to protect your health; the caution is not to try to do so too quickly or too forcefully. Slow and steady wins the race. Starting with small goals like a daily short, vigorous workout  could very well lead you to where you want to be.

If you have difficulty seeing and sensing that about yourself and your life, spend some time in nature. Find a natural thing that you find awe-inspiring, whether that\u2019s a beautiful vista, a waterfall, or an old tree.

Sometimes things do "just happen," if that is the case - rest assured you are by no means alone in that experience, and reach out for support. The support you need is truly always available.

How might you have contributed to the current situation or current difficulties, if you are currently in a relationship? When you draw this card in reverse and you are looking for love, know that although you may feel as though you are ready for a long-term, loving relationship, that there may be ways in which you are standing in your own way to prevent love from coming to you. For example, if you are too eager to make changes to your own life, in order to \u201cfit\u201d with a partner, you may in fact need to develop stronger boundaries and a stronger sense of self before a true, loving, long term relationship will come about for you.

Too much emphasis on either aspect of life throws the other into imbalance. Seek the best advice you can find before making any major changes with regard to your working life.

This is especially true for those raised in fundamentalist or evangelical religions. Examine your long-held beliefs and see if they withstand the light of day.

Allow yourself to feel what you feel, but don\u2019t wallow in pain or sorrow; if you need help pulling yourself away from any pain or loss that you are suffering, reach out.

And then, it will be helpful to  take action, take whatever steps you can to give yourself the feeling, however slight, of \u201cbeing in control.\u201d Even if that is merely making a choice on what you are going to have for dinner. Small steps are important, too. Do not look on this as a negative card, particularly when it comes up in reversal.', 'Spirituality': u' The potential stress levels indicated by the upright Devil are not quite as serious when the card is drawn in reverse. Even so, this is a time that you need to watch out for being overworked, overtired, and over-stressed. Exercise will help, as will anything that draws you \u201cout of yourself\u201d rather than staying focused on your own problems. As with all the other indications of this card, you are only as hamstrung by health issues\u2014at least in the mental and emotional sense\u2014as you allow yourself to be. Push for improvement, yet don\u2019t torture yourself because of the physical limitations that you have. It is what it is. ', 'Health': u' This is an important time to realize when you draw the devil reversed that any job that claims to be \u201cpermanent\u201d and secure in this day and age is unfortunately unlikely to be so secure forever. This does not have to be a bad thing, information and knowledge is power; and knowing that you have options is a far more powerful mental place to \u201cbe\u201d than feeling like you must stay in a situation forever because you think it is secure and protective.  Far too many people in recent years have seen the benefits etc., and promised pensions be taken away at the stroke of a judges\u2019 pen. Yes, you must do your own part, but security comes from within, not from out there in the world. If you are in an unhappy job situation which you are enduring because of the \u201csecurity,\u201d stay aware that this is a choice that you are making, nothing has been foisted upon you. If you don\u2019t feel the trade-off is worth your unhappiness, start putting out feelers and giving thought to what you can do to change the situation. You are not trapped unless you allow yourself  to be trapped. There are always, always options of one sort or another.', 'Finances': u' With the reversed Devil card, your attitude and positive mindset is still very important. Especially if you are having difficulty keeping a good attitude, consider who you surround yourself with and who your friends are. Do you have positive people in your midst, or are you surrounded by overly critical, fault-finding people who complain and nitpick you to the point where you\u2019re even less able to function well? Take stock, then take action. Life is short, and attitudes are catching. This card reminds you, again, that no matter what it looks like on the surface, you are not truly trapped. Even if you are literally in jail, they cannot constrain your spirit, your soul, or your  mind. Use the freedom you have. ', 'ID': 38}, 39: {'Love': u' When you draw the Tower in reverse, generally the concerns for a love relationship are not as intense as they are when the card appears in an upright position. However, it is an indicator that the relationship needs more work and more communication if it is to survive. Think positively and don\u2019t focus on \u201cchanging your partner,\u201d consider how you are contributing to the situation and ways in which you can improve your own part of the relationship. Take one step at a time and don\u2019t lose your cool. ', 'Name': u'The Tower Reversed', 'General': u" When the Tower shows in reverse, it is unfortunately still a possibility that  some people/situations that you have counted on as being \u201cthere for you\u201d may no longer be there in quite the same way. Try not to over-think this, it doesn't have to indicate a major, horrible change in life. It\u2019s just some change. Stay mindful of the reality that you  either already have \u2013 or can get - all the resources you need, to deal with life and to do what you need to do.", 'Spirituality': u' Again, the Tower reversed indicates a somewhat milder version of the upright interpretation. Still, it is important in the next few days for you to be careful and to pay particular attention to what you are doing in situations which could be dangerous, like, perhaps, driving, or mowing the lawn! Stay steady and know that this too will pass.', 'Health': u' When the Tower appears in reverse, people around you may be unusually stressed, and arguments and misunderstandings are going to be happening a lot. It is important that you don\u2019t take these personally, and that you don\u2019t involve yourself in conflict unnecessarily or let your ego take over. With the reversed Tower, it\u2019s especially critical to think before you speak. ', 'Finances': u' As with the upright meaning, the reversed Tower tells us that this is a time to keep a positive attitude as much as possible, regardless of what is happening around you, count your blessings,  and don\u2019t take things personally which are not personal. New understandings and insights may come to you in the blink of an eye.', 'ID': 39}, 40: {'Love': u' When reversed, the Star still bodes very well for love relationships, especially existing love relationships. However, there may be a stumbling block on one or both sides which will need to be resolved before the really excellent possibilities for the relationship can come shining through. Think about what the blocks might be on your side (the only side you can truly change) and work through them. If you are single and feel that you\u2019re ready for love, again, consider what may be standing in the way of attracting the relationship you want. Is it your self esteem - too low, or too high, bordering  on arrogance? First think that through, work on it, then get out and mingle. A new relationship could happen soon. But first you need to examine and/or eliminate any  blocks.', 'Name': u'The Star Reversed', 'General': u' The Star reversed is still a good omen. Look hard at what you are feeling and discern whether, if you looked a little deeper, you could find reasons to be more optimistic and helpful. When this card appears in reverse, often we are tending to look on the darker side. Lift up your eyes! If you are drawing breath, there is always something you can be thankful for.  ', 'Spirituality': u" Even when The Star appears reversed, this should be a very good time, health wise. If you are waiting on test results of some kind, they are likely to be very good results. You'll be calm, and inspired. Trust in your body\u2019s strength and wisdom. ", 'Health': u' When you draw the Star reversed, it indicated that you may have a lot of powerfully positive opportunities in front of you which you are not seeing. Think about not only how to make the best of the situation you are in now, but also about your ideal situation, e.g. where you want to be work-wise five years from now. Picture your \u201cperfect\u201d scenario, then take steps to make it happen. ', 'Finances': u' You are so in touch with your spirituality now that this is a great time for you to reach out to others, and to share your wisdom and your joy. Your efforts to do so will be repaid many times over. Even reversed, the numerological translation of The Star equates to the concept of \u201cstrength.\u201d Your spirit is coming through strongly when this card appears; trust yourself.', 'ID': 40}, 41: {'Love': u' As with the upright meaning, the reversed moon can point to a highly emotional and/or uncomfortable time in love relationships. Things can quickly become heated and/or negative. Take a break from each other and/or the relationship if you need to. Don\u2019t make assumptions, and fight fairly, if you\u2019re going to fight. Don\u2019t ignore your intuition, however. To do so would make you even more irritable, upset, and perhaps, anxious. Pick your battles and be sure to treat your lover like a friend. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to end or to begin a relationship. This is probably not the best time for either course of action. ', 'Name': u'The Moon Reversed', 'General': u' You are definitely in a more \u201cpsychic and intuitive phase\u201d than usual, so it will be important for you to trust your instincts and your impressions, even if you don\u2019t know where they are coming from. However, when you draw the reversed Moon, the impressions you are getting may be less than clear and easily misinterpreted. Even so, don\u2019t ignore the messages you are getting. Try to suss out their meaning.  As with the upright meaning of this card, If you are waiting on an answer from someone, it may unfortunately take quite a bit longer than you would like for it to. Try to stay patient.', 'Spirituality': u" This is a critically important time for you to follow your intuition as to your health issues, provided you don\u2019t go against the advice given by a qualified medical practitioner. As with the upright meaning of the moon, when the Moon is reversed, look carefully at the diagnosese and feelings that you have about your health care providers.  If a diagnosis (whether that\u2019s positive or negative) doesn't feel right, or you don\u2019t feel comfortable with your health care provider\u2026. get a second opinion or a new provider.

", 'Health': u' When the Moon appears in reverse, things unfortunately may not seem clear in the slightest with your work. Most damaging of all is when you think you are clear on something and you actually are not. It will be important that you ask questions, particularly of your superiors, and practice \u201cactive listening\u201d to make sure that you and your co-workers understand each other perfectly. Stay as patient and calm as you can, and particularly if you are feeling \u201cattacked,\u201d give your coworkers and supervisors the benefit of any doubt. Reality may not be anywhere close to as bad as you think. Don\u2019t push for major changes on the work front; the time may not be right, unless you are looking for a new position.', 'Finances': u' When you draw the reversed moon, this is still a very spiritual time and a great time to get a reading, have healing work, or to seek other helpful input from spiritual types. You are more psychically open than usual now (although when the card is reversed, the messages you are getting may be more difficult to interpret.) As with the upright meaning of the card, the reversed moon tells you to pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, and to flashes of information that come seemingly out of nowhere.

At the same time both parties may need some \u201calone time.\u201d If you draw the reversed Sun when you are looking for love and romance, the indication here is that possibilities look promising for you, however you will need to keep a good attitude, and have (or develop) high self esteem. You don\u2019t want to accept just any old lover that comes along. You deserve more than that.', 'Name': u'The Sun Reversed', 'General': u' Things in general are very likely to be going very well for you, even when you draw the reversed Sun.

Figure out what you've been doing right\u2026 and build upon it! Again, you have a lot to be grateful for. Make a point to acknowledge this.", 'Health': u" The reversed Sun can indicate that if you\u2019re looking for a new job, it could be right around the corner for you. You'll need to stay focused on what you bring to the table and how your skills and talents could benefit the employer, not so much what \u201cthey\u201d could do for you! The reversed sun shows a particular need for you to share any credit for good work with those who work with you (even if you did all or nearly all of the work!) On the whole, if you are currently employed, your work is stable and moving toward new opportunities and improvements. Just don\u2019t take your employment for granted when this card appears.

If you are the one tending to \u201cjump to conclusions,\u201d you can, and should, change this. If others are making these kinds of decisions about you or about someone you care for, there is really very little you can do, apart from realizing that it\u2019s their problem, not yours.

Control what you can and ignore the rest.', 'Spirituality': u' When you pull this card in reverse in connection with health issues, it\u2019s a signal that accepting that it is okay for you to make mistakes or to even be wrong on occasion will go a long way toward helping you to feel better. Judgment reversed is a reminder not to fight change, and to accept that the past is over, and that letting go of anger over the past will help you to feel better. Think positively.', 'Health': u" When you draw reversed Judgment, know that things may be changing at work.

If you've been slacking off, now is the time to get with the program, before any permanent damage is done.

Take one step at a time. ", 'Finances': u" Judgment in reverse again reminds you of the need to be open to new ideas and new experiences. Change is a constant in life. That doesn't mean that you should just change everything willy-nilly, and get rid of spiritual practice that comforts you completely, only that you will benefit from looking at new and different approaches.

You don\'t forgive others for THEIR sake, or because they "deserve it," necessarily, you do it for your own sake, because holding on to anger and pain is toxic and bad for you.

(Hint: the emotional is very often tied to the physical.) Talk therapy may be very useful.

Be clear and specific about what you want in a relationship, evaluate your choices thoughtfully, be honest and as clear as you can be with all people involved (including yourself) then move ahead. Beware falling in love with the "heady rush" that happens only at the beginning of a relationship. In no relationship does that rush last forever. Good relationships, even soul mate relationships, will settle into a less "rush-based" comfort zone at some point.

If so, she would be a once very kind and understanding person, who has now morphed into basically a control freak, and at minimum her loving ways might have turned into being more judgmental and untrustworthy.

Treat your body with care and compassion. Learn as much as you can about supporting health and treatment options.', 'Health': u' At times the reversed King of Cups can point to an upcoming emotional outburst from a man at work. This can be unsettling at first, but after some time, everyone involved should have learned something positive and important about the situation(s).

But the issues/the outburst may need to be "unpacked" with him, later, to get to the bottom of things.', 'Finances': u' The reversed King of Cups can indicate a tendency to be cavalier when it comes to spiritual seeking. It\'s important to think for yourself, and explore for your own self, when he appears. Don\'t follow a flock, and above all, think deeply many, many times, before making major life changes to, say, join an ascetic spiritual community in Tibet when you\'ve never previously left the country. If that\'s where your spirit calls you, that\'s fine, but be cautious. Take one step at a time. There is no need to hurry.

Do the best that you can at work, but realize that your work is not your whole life, and know that some people (which may include the man represented by this reversed King) simply cannot be pleased. All you can do is your best, and that's enough. ", 'Finances': u' The reversed King of Pentacles says that you may have been placing too much emphasis, for too long, on your financial security. Who you are has very little to do with what you do for a living. You may benefit greatly from exploring some different spiritual traditions and understandings now; your mind will be opened as a result, if you allow it to be.', 'ID': 100}, 101: {'Love': u" In terms of love, the Ace can mean that you are ready to start something new, and if you're currently in a committed relationship, it can indicate that there's something about this relationship that you will choose to put a stop to.

If something in the relationship is hurtful or bad for you, and you lose your partner because you say so - you haven't really lost, you are being guided toward a relationship that is better for you. Tell the truth.", 'Name': u'Ace Of Swords', 'General': u' In general the Ace of Swords calls on us to not be afraid to make a leap if it\'s in our best interests. In short, bravery is called for. As the old adage says, "feel the fear and do it anyway." You have a good idea already of what must be done. The hard part is the doing of it. Start today. ', 'Spirituality': u" In terms of health, you may finally find it within yourself to stop some bad habits that you know are bad for you. (This can also indicate the converse - finally starting something that is good for you!) Expect some frayed nerves as you're making this transition. Take good care of yourself, only then will you truly be able to care adequately for others. Physical exercise is particularly important now, but don't overdo it. ", 'Health': u' In the context of work, the Ace can mean that you soon will try a different tactic or may even choose to leave the job that you\'re currently in. If you\'re committed to staying where you are, you may have some good ideas for new policies or procedures that could make everyone\'s life easier at work and improve the bottom line/final product. Don\'t hesitate to give voice to those. Another old adage: "It\'s amazing what can be done if you don\'t care who gets the credit." You will ultimately get the credit for anything good that you bring to the table. The credit doesn\'t have to be instantaneous. ', 'Finances': u" You may finally let go of a belief system which actually hasn't worked for you for some time. Don't beat yourself up if you find you had been holding some viewpoints and beliefs that you shouldn't have.  Everyone makes mistakes or gets hold of the wrong end of the stick from time to time.  You will find some spiritual truths that hold more promise for you and which are beneficial. Don't hesitate to talk to others about what works for them on a spiritual level. ", 'ID': 101}, 102: {'Love': u' The 2 of Swords is a good omen romantically, especially for a romance that is already in existence. This card can signify that your relationship will move into a lighter, easier, more balanced phase, with treating each other as equals playing a major role. If you are looking for love, take a good hard look at yourself to see if you have any outstanding emotional issues that need to be dealt with FIRST. People can smell desperation a mile away, and it is a major turn-off. A life partner does not complete you; a life partner is icing on the cake of your own complete life. Do not look outside yourself for happiness. Then the relationship you truly want and need will come.', 'Name': u'2 Of Swords', 'General': u' In general the 2 of Swords tells us that your partnerships are likely to be going at least somewhat well, whether these be friendships, romantic, or business. However, you should consider the depths of your commitment to equality in these and whether or not you are being treated as an equal by your partners. If you are not, it may be time to bring things back into balance. This will almost certainly require open communication on your part. Nothing changes without effort. ', 'Spirituality': u" When this card appears in the context of health questions, it signifies a need to pay very close attention to one's emotions. How are you feeling about things/people in your life? Journalizing and/or talking things out with someone you trust is very important now and can lead to a healthier outcome/to health breakthroughs. Positive thinking and balanced behavior is crucial now. Eating right, sleeping enough, getting enough exercise, drinking enough fluids.", 'Health': u" You may be stuck waiting on a decision that has to be made by other people. Try to be patient and refrain from pushing people to move before they are ready. If you have done your homework, things are likely to work out in your favor. Make sure you have done what you are supposed to do work wise, and if you haven't, figure out how to explain and/or make amends, as you are likely to be called to account. Don't panic. ", 'Finances': u" When the 2 appears in relation to questions regarding spirituality, it shows that you are on a more balanced and positive path than you realize. Hold fast to what you believe and how you see things, even if your  system doesn't work for everyone. ", 'ID': 102}, 103: {'Love': u' In the context of love this card does not have to be the death knell of a relationship, but it does almost always point to relationship difficulty and pain. In order for the relationship to survive, both parties must be willing to work on and talk about the relationship. You may find that someone you thought cared about you is not as loving as you had supposed. Do not take this too personally or dwell too long on the pain, if that is the case. You are being guided to the relationship that is right for you. You cannot force something to be right or someone to care if they do not. The right person will care - of their own accord - without you doing  intense contortions, so to speak, to make it happen.', 'Name': u'3 Of Swords', 'General': u" In general, this card can point to very deep emotional issues that must be addressed before the querent can move on. Denying pain does not make it go away (any more than denying a broken leg makes it heal.) However, attention must be paid to balance here also as it must be paid with the 2 of Swords. Allow yourself to experience any pain that comes up now, but do not wallow in it. You do not and should not wallow in grief or sorrow for long. However only you can decide how long is long enough. Others can't decide it for you.", 'Spirituality': u' The news about your health may not be as good as you had hoped, and/or emotions/depression/anxiety may be taking a toll on your physical being. Keeping a positive attitude is of the utmost importance now, no matter what your situation or prognosis might be. Remember that doctors are not gods. Treat yourself with loving kindness. Read about miraculous healings. If you need help to stay positive - ask for it. Surround yourself with healthy, positive influences to the best of your ability. ', 'Health': u" Your feelings or ego may be quite bruised by something that happens with relation to work. Try to keep this in perspective. Your whole life is not (or should not be) what you do professionally. You may need some assistance to find a better approach to work. Don't hesitate to ask. If you're looking for work, this too may show a need to look in a different way or in a different field than the one you've been pursuing. Hang in there.", 'Finances': u' This is not a time to try to hold on to things, ideas, situations, or people which may have run their course in your life. You must make room in your life/heart/emotions/spirit for new things to come to you. Time alone will be helpful. Have you done all the healing that you need to do?

It is important to let your partner know what is going on inside, but remember that your feelings are your own, it is not necessarily their job to try to make you feel fabulous all the time. It may be that you simply need some time apart. Don't hesitate to take it. If you're looking for love, now is not the time to push. You'd be better off getting very, very specific about exactly what you are looking for in a relationship. The time will come when you will meet someone. That time is probably not in the immediate.", 'Name': u'4 Of Swords', 'General': u" In general this card usually means that you are needing some time and space to yourself. Others may be pushing too hard for bits of your time and attention. Don't hesitate to draw boundaries for yourself or to say no. Conversely, when others say no to you, take them at their word. Pushing in this circumstance is asking for trouble.", 'Spirituality': u' This card signifies a need, in the context of health, to count your blessings. Your health may not be all that you would like it to be, on the other hand, it is doubtless better than that of many other people. Be grateful for what you have. This card can also show a need to slow down and take it easy. Pushing yourself when you are too tired can cause illness or injury. Everyone needs rest and time alone.', 'Health': u" This is a great time to take some time off from work if you can (even a long weekend.) you need a break and some perspective. Things are not likely to be going as you would like them to do - don't take this personally or try to push harder. Sometimes we just need to be patient with the process. If you can't stand the need for patience, perhaps the time has come to start looking for another position.", 'Finances': u' In the context of spirituality, this card indicates a need for space. You need time and quiet, to really get in touch with your soul and the universal energies around us all. Even if you work full time and have fourteen children, if you make it a priority, you can find a minute or two of solitude. Find it and take it. Your sanity, and your soul, is crying out for this.

Think calmly and carefully about what your deal-breakers are in a relationship. Be honest with yourself first, then be honest with your beloved. Accept reality.', 'Name': u'5 Of Swords', 'General': u" In general, the 5 of Swords can indicate that someone you care about may be away for a while. Don't get too possessive if that's the case. Assume that they will be coming back to you. The 5 can indicate conflicts, both external and internal. Don't escalate conflicts unnecessarily. Think before you act.", 'Spirituality': u" You're likely to be under stress from a combination of factors, so it's particularly important when this card appears to be gentle with yourself. If you're angry, allow yourself to express it (safely and carefully) rather than turning your anger and sorrow on yourself. Rest and relaxation is crucial. Worry and guilt are useless. Let them go.", 'Health': u" In the context of work, the 5 can show that you may be your own worst enemy. Don't expect the entire system to be changed just because you believe it should be different. How you speak your mind is as important as what you say. There may be some unfairness at play in your work world. Be sure that your behavior is impeccable.", 'Finances': u" Even if you have suddenly found the spiritual answers that you've been looking for your whole life, remember that they are your answers and not everyone else's. You don't need to convert anyone else to your way of thinking. The 5 of Swords can also indicate a sudden break from spirituality that no longer works for you. Give yourself time and space to find new answers, if that's the case.", 'ID': 105}, 106: {'Love': u" In the context of love, the 6 of Swords can depict the need for a change of scenery. If you are already in a relationship, take your beloved on a trip, even if it's just down the street for a picnic or something of the sort. If you're looking for love, this card points to a need to get out of your routines and your usual haunts if you want to meet someone new. Explore. ", 'Name': u'6 Of Swords', 'General': u" Generally the 6 shows at least a slight reduction in stress and strain. Things may not be perfect, but they are going to be better than they may have been in the recent past. Take this time to get your head above water and decide where you're going from here. Even a short break or change of scenery will be helpful. This doesn't have to cost money. ", 'Spirituality': u" If you are dealing with a health problem, your usual health care practitioner may not be the best one to help you. If you can do so, look into clinics and treatment outside your local area. Barring a serious health problem, this card can show that what you truly need most of all is a vacation or a change of scenery. Find a way to give this to yourself, even if the only way you can do it is just by talking to people you've never talked to before.", 'Health': u" You may make the decision or be in the process of leaving a job that no longer works for you. Trust that the universe is taking you to where you want to be, and that all this is happening for a reason. Don't hesitate to ask for help or to seek new information as you are getting your bearings in your new environment. The 6 can also point to a literal change in the place where you do business. This is a good thing.", 'Finances': u' Some spiritual answers that have eluded you for some time may come in to your awareness suddenly. This is sometimes tied to a change in routine; travel, or experimenting with different spiritual traditions. Pay attention to your dreams. They often show you things you miss during your waking hours.', 'ID': 106}, 107: {'Love': u" If you're already in a committed relationship when this card appears, the clear message is that trust is crucial. If you're feeling suspicious for some reason about your partner, make a point to talk about this even if it's difficult. Being passive-aggressive is only going to make things worse. If you're looking for love, you may meet someone interesting now, but try to avoid appearing as though you just aren't interested in a relationship; prospective suitors will move on to someone who is more engaged. Strive for balance.", 'Name': u'7 Of Swords', 'General': u" If you are involved in any sort of competition this month (formal or informal) you will want to keep a close eye out for any cheating. This can range from anything from someone cheating at a pick-up poker game to someone trying to frame you at work for something serious. The bottom line is basically to cover your tail, make sure you are doing things the right way, and then you'll have nothing to worry about, even if someone is out to get you.", 'Spirituality': u' Don\'t take the first pronouncement you hear about your health as the gospel. Get a second or even third opinion before you sign up for anything that is irrevocable health-wise (invasive procedures or surgery.) Be open to spiritual healing, but if you are struggling with a serious illness, know that a cure is not always equated with "healing." There are many ways to heal. What exactly needs healing in you and in your life?', 'Health': u" In the context of work, the appearance of the 7 of Swords can mean that your employer is looking at your work and conduct very closely. Keep your shoulder to the grindstone, and make sure your work is above reproach. Try not to get involved in work politics. If you're looking for work, don't hesitate to speak to people you know or have worked with in the past.", 'Finances': u" Be very cautious about religious or spiritual gurus or leaders that require your money in exchange for so-called enlightenment. The truth is that you don't necessarily need a leader to learn and grow spiritually. Explore on your own. Be careful with new-found spiritual friends.", 'ID': 107}, 108: {'Love': u' In the context of love, the 8 of Swords points to a need to seriously re-evaluate a relationship. You may be sticking with someone that is actually bad for you, since you figure it\'s "better than nothing." If that\'s the case, rethink. Being in an unhealthy relationship is much worse than being alone. If you are looking for love, first look at how well you love yourself. Someone else cannot come along and fix you. Start where you are.', 'Name': u'8 Of Swords', 'General': u' In general, the 8 tells us that we must be open to defeat in order to ever possibly win. Do not fear the unknown; many blessings reside for you there. Examine your thoughts, speech, and behavior for negativity and know that what you say and do and the choices that you make affect the outcomes in your life. If you need help managing and dealing with your fears, ask for it.', 'Spirituality': u' More than anything else, in the context of health, this card points to the mind/body connection and the urgency with which we all need to look at our thoughts and expectations and behaviors when we are dealing with troublesome symptoms or health conditions. We do not create every symptom or illness (genetics and environment certainly can play a role), but health is almost always made worse when our thinking is mainly negative or filled with anxiety. Such things can be buried very deep. Find help if you need to in order to unearth these damaging negative patterns.', 'Health': u' If you hate your work, believe that you hold the power to change your situation because you do. There may not be a whole lot that you can do to change your specific work environment, but that should not keep you from looking for a different, better situation if that is what your heart and spirit is crying out for. You cannot have it both ways; either you want out of your current situation or you are prepared to put up with the way things are. Which one is it?', 'Finances': u' Know that you have the answers that you need inside already. Time spent in quiet and in meditation will be helpful. If you still need direction, ask spirit and the universe for signs and signals. These can be as subtle as repeatedly seeing a phrase or hearing a song. You are not kept down unless you allow yourself to be kept down. ', 'ID': 108}, 109: {'Love': u" Something may be troubling you with regard to your relationship. Don't ignore your gut feelings. If you feel that something in your relationship is unhealthy, you are very likely quite correct. If you suspect that something is going on behind your back, your best bet is to ask your partner about it. If you've recently met someone, don't get too carried away that believing all is what it seems to be. Trust takes time to develop. Don't be in too much of a hurry.", 'Name': u'9 Of Swords', 'General': u' You will need to guard against a feeling of anxiety. If you are feeling anxious, take a good look at whether or not any of that is under your own power or control (and thus, you could lessen it) or if other things or people in your life are contributing to this anxiety. If it is the latter, take a good look at that, and see whether or not something in the relationship can be changed to make it more workable for you. There\'s something about this time period that can cause people to feel like their life should be, in some way, "more" or "bigger" than it is. Try to take comfort and joy in the ordinary things. That\'s where the beauty is.', 'Spirituality': u" This is a time to be very cautious about your intake of substances such as drugs or alcohol, because you may be self medicating, when what you really need is to get to the bottom of what is bugging you. Stress can be taking a mighty toll. Look at ways to mitigate your risk factors and to deal with stress. If all else fails, think about changing your lifestyle and the things you're spending your money on. Sometimes it really is money or your life, in more ways than being robbed at gunpoint.", 'Health': u" Worrying about your job is not going to help matters. Focus on what you can control, and try to leave your anxiety by the wayside. If you are looking for work, think positively, and don't hesitate to ask for help in your search. The next person you talk to about may just be the one who knows of an opening which would be perfect for you.", 'Finances': u" When the 9 appears in the context of spirituality, it's a clear sign that you must slow down your rocketing brain and stress level. If you can do it on your own, meditation will bring you enormous benefits. If you don't have any idea how to begin, read a good book or take a class. Read up on the Buddhist concept of the monkey mind. Learn to silence the chatter.", 'ID': 109}, 110: {'Love': u" In relation to love questions, this is sadly not a good omen. Something about the love situation you are in is not quite right. Ask yourself a lot of questions, accept reality, don't close your eyes to the truth.

The contenders you've met so far are not who they seem to be. ", 'Name': u'10 Of Swords', 'General': u' In general, when the 10 comes up in relation to a question as to whether you can believe what a person is telling you, or trust that a situation is stable, this is a pretty clear answer of "no." However, try to bear in mind that whenever a door closes, another door opens. You are being guided to a situation that is better for you. Trust yourself and trust in the universe.

There is much more to life than what meets the eye, and miracles happen every day. However, you have to be sure that you are doing your part. What can you do, right now, to better your health situation? Consider alternative healing methods.", 'Health': u" The appearance of this card may signal that your work situation is about to come to an end. Your best bet is to get your ducks in a row and think through what you will do if you do indeed lose your job, for any reason. You may have been treated badly by someone.

If you're looking for work, a potential position that you'd pinned your hopes on may not come through. Above all, don't give up.", 'Finances': u' You may finally let go of a long, deeply held spiritual belief that has actually been standing in your way. Again, you must be careful where you put your trust in terms of spiritual leaders who may seem to have your best interests at heart but who may actually be looking only to line their pockets. You make a break from the past. This is actually a good thing, although it may be somewhat painful.', 'ID': 110}, 111: {'Love': u" In love questions, the Page of Swords points to mild conflict. Know when to push and when to back off, many fights and discussions are not actually worth having (as long as your partner is treating you with respect.) Allow your partner to have his or her space.

Love doesn't drop out of the sky by itself.", 'Name': u'Page Of Swords', 'General': u' In general the Page of Swords tells us that the querent may be trying too hard, pushing too fast, or in general stepping on the toes of others. You may need to study the body language of others, and consider how well you do (or do not) accept constructive criticism from others. You are likely to have a great deal of mental and physical energy now. Use it wisely.', 'Spirituality': u" When the Page comes up in relation to health matters, chances are good that you have been overdoing it, working too hard, behaving too intensely. Give yourself and the others around you a break, your frayed nerves demand it. Silence and rest works wonders.

If you're looking for work, you may need to behave with a great deal of humility in interviews to land the position you've been hoping for (but don't put yourself down.) Be cautious with contracts.", 'Finances': u" You may have been ignoring your spiritual side. Even the most logical secular humanist in the world must realize that there is an esoteric side to the world that is not necessarily immediately visible to the eye or logical.

You can harness your own healing energy and power now.", 'Health': u" In relation to work questions, this is a particularly good omen if you are looking for work. A job that is just what you've been hoping for may suddenly come your way. If already employed, things are about to get a lot busier, in a very positive way.

Before you undertake a regimen of any type, do some due diligence, find out what it is all about and what others have said who have tried the same approach. The same can be true of traditional doctors; if you are prescribed medication, it\'s important that you know what it is, why you\'re taking it, and check the dosage. Do your best to think as clearly and non-emotionally about your health as you can. ', 'Health': u" In the context of work, the reversed Ace can mean that you are close to having a major misunderstanding about work. Don't make any sudden moves, and don't decide that a job which has been good for you for many years has suddenly gone bad.

Be practical and realistic now, and think things through carefully. ", 'Finances': u' Again, the reversed Ace can show that you are in a mindset that means it is easy to get overly invested in spiritual ideas which in the long run may prove to be of little value to you. Be cautious about forceful people who try to get you involved in new organizations -  particularly "spiritual" organizations which require you to pay to belong.

', 'Name': u'2 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' In general the reversed 2 of Swords tells us that your partnerships are likely to deepen and become more important in your life, and this refers to partnerships of all kinds. However, beware putting too much emphasis on any one partnership. You have several that need to be priorities in your life. ', 'Spirituality': u'When this card appears in the context of health questions, it signifies that any health changes are likely to take place slowly. And this may be for the best, regardless of how fast you\'d like things to "move." For example, losing too much weight too quickly can cause gallbladder issues for some people. Take things one day at a time and note small changes. You are likely to feel better and more healthy - just not overnight. ', 'Health': u' It is important that you allow yourself to be open to others at work when the reversed 2 of Swords appears. Even though you may be sure that your ideas are the best ones, over time you may find that there is reason and good outcomes because of the plans and ideas of others. This is a time to be seen as a team player. They are not all out to get you, no matter what it may look like on the surface. ', 'Finances': u' When the reversed 2 of swords appears in relation to questions regarding spirituality, it is easy to get carried away with spiritual ideas that appear to work for others, but which may not work for you. Be skeptical and cautious. There may be some misguided people who try to "bring you into their fold" now. You don\'t have to allow this. Be your own person. ', 'ID': 116}, 117: {'Love': u" In the context of love the reversed 3 of Swords points to misunderstandings, sadness, and sorrow. A relationship may have just ended, or one that you were sure would come together has not done so. Allow yourself to feel any pain as a result, but don't turn it into self-persecution. We all have more than one soul-mate on the planet. Remember that when one door closes in life - another always opens. ", 'Name': u'3 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' In general, the reversed 3 of Swords indicates a likely disappointment. This does not necessarily mean something major or life-shattering, just that something that you hoped for may not come through as you would have preferred. Allow yourself to feel any pain that comes as a result, and move on. It is truly not the end of the world. ', 'Spirituality': u" You may not have all the information that you need about your health when the 3 of Swords reversed comes up. Investigate on your own, see a doctor or a different doctor, if you are having health problems. Don't discount what medical professionals tell you; however if your gut tells you that you need a second opinion, then get one. Anxiety may be taking a major toll; if you are feeling anxious and it's interfering with your life, make sure that you express this to your health care provider. Major anxiety can all but destroy your quality of life, but it can be controlled. To get it controlled, though, you must talk about it. ", 'Health': u' It is very easy to misunderstand people and entire situations at work when the 3 of Swords appears in a work context. Your best bet is to ask questions and not make assumptions, and to be as clear as possible in your own communications. Don\'t be too "think skinned" when this card comes up. People may inadvertently be insulting, in many cases you should just try to let this roll off your back now. ', 'Finances': u' The 3 of Swords again indicates that things may not be entirely clear to you in the spiritual realm. Be wary if you meet new people who claim to have "all the answers" spiritually. Their answers may not be your answers. There\'s no harm in exploring different spiritual understandings and traditions, however, this is probably not the time to commit to any of them.', 'ID': 117}, 118: {'Love': u' The reversed 4 of Swords, if you are currently in a romantic relationship, can show that you will need to make extra effort to find yourself feeling more "together" with your partner. However, you also need to stay alert to the fact that your partner may be exhausted for other reasons (such as health or work) and if so, you need to not take this personally. If you are looking for love and coming up empty handed, and this has been so for some time, then it is definitely time to change your tactics. For instance if you\'ve been looking online, try groups which meet in person; or vice-versa.', 'Name': u'4 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' Generally, the reversed 4 of Swords means that in addition to feeling tired, you may be feeling a bit isolated. Do not look at this as a permanent situation. Allow yourself to rest, and know that the relationships and friendships that you need are coming. Take one step at a time. ', 'Spirituality': u" The reversed 4 of Swords can indicate that you are about to finally put some self-limiting beliefs behind you - and this can cause major leaps forward both in your outlook and in your health. However, this card is a clear indicator that you must rest, that you have been pushing yourself far too hard. Especially if you feel you can't afford to take a day off - that means that you really, really need to do so. ", 'Health': u' As with the upright 4 of Swords, the reversed 4 suggests that some time off from work would be beneficial. You may also find that something about the way things are done at work/in your field which has never seemed "right" to you may become a lot clearer and you\'ll find yourself supporting this practice. If you are looking for work, it may be important to take at least a few hours\' break to rethink. Are you looking in the right place, with the right people? This card suggests that you may need to change tactics. ', 'Finances': u' When it comes to spirituality, the reversed 4 indicates a need for NO action, rather than pushing yourself further. Stillness, meditation, and rest, can open up your spirit more now than anything else you could possibly do or attend. Consider meditation on the following: "Peace, Be Still."', 'ID': 118}, 119: {'Love': u' When the 5 of Swords reversed appears in the context of love, you may be sacrificing your happiness because of a need to show/feel that you are "right." People have sensibly asked "Do you want to be \'right\' or do you want to be happy?" Sometimes you have to let go of your ego and simply accept things, whether you are looking for love or whether you are in in a long-term relationship. ', 'Name': u'5 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' In general, the reversed 5 of Swords can indicate power struggles and conflicts. As they say, pick your battles. Not everything is worth fighting for or about. Consider your priorities and the things that matter most to you. Be as pleasant to others as you can muster. ', 'Spirituality': u" The reversed 5 of Swords shows that you may be under tremendous stress now. However, at least some of this is stress which you are causing for yourself. Back up and realize that you can control some of this. You don't have to (and can't) do everything. Make time for rest and relaxation, and realize that not everything must be perfect. You are human, after all. Forgive yourself. ", 'Health': u" In the context of work, the reversed 5 can show that you may be shooting your own self in the foot. Do not create conflict where none exists if you remotely want to keep your job, and do not escalate conflicts that are already there, unnecessarily. Accept situations as they are, unless something illegal or immoral is happening, and if it's the latter, consider making a report to the appropriate authorities. Some problems are too big to try to solve on your own. ", 'Finances': u' You may have removed yourself from a spiritual tradition from your past, or, for instance, finally told your romantic partner that you no longer wish to attend services of your/their faith community. This may feel like a "win" and it is good that you stood up for your desires, however, your spiritual needs do not just stop or go away; how will you fill them? Don\'t pretend that your spiritual needs no longer exist. Look for like-minded people, who see spirituality in the way that you do.', 'ID': 119}, 120: {'Love': u' In the context of love, the 6 of Swords reversed can show that you are about to confront some necessary issues in order for your relationship to move forward. This does not have to involve fights or arguments, if you communicate calmly and well. This is not a time to hold things in, however, again, think before you start spouting things off. You could cause enormous damage if you are not thoughtful about how you "speak your piece." ', 'Name': u'6 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' Generally the reversed 6 of Swords shows that you may well make some new discoveries and decisions; and you may have some important information that you wish to share. However, the way in which you communicate is at least as important as what it is that you have to say. Think carefully about what you need to "get across." ', 'Spirituality': u" With the reversed 6 of Swords, something in your life may be out of balance, and this can be causing health challenges. Give some thought to where this imbalance may lie. Are you eating too much? Not enough? Not getting enough exercise? Correct the imbalance and you'll find yourself feeling better, perhaps more so than you have for years. ", 'Health': u' This is an energy under which simple mistakes can cause major problems at work. Be especially careful with important documents and correspondence; make sure your work is backed up and carefully stored. If you are looking for work, you may feel as though you are "on your own," in your quest. That\'s not such a bad thing - allow yourself to look for work in places no one else might suggest or consider. ', 'Finances': u' You may feel overwhelmed spiritually when the 6 of Swords appears. Everything and nothing may seem to make sense to you spiritually, all at the same time. The answer to this is to relax and empty your mind, rather than trying to grasp onto one "answer." In time, you will realize the direction that you need to go. For now, give yourself some peace. Everything that grows does so in stages, not all at once.', 'ID': 120}, 121: {'Love': u' You may be feeling a sense of dissatisfaction with your love relationships when this card appears. If that is the case, and you are in a committed relationship, give deep thought to why and what you are dissatisfied about before speaking to your partner about it. Also consider what your role is in the conflict or problem in the relationship. Is there something you should or could be doing differently?', 'Name': u'7 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' This is a time to think carefully about the way things are "supposed to be done," and whether or not you are meeting that standard. It may be time to clean up your act. Take things one step at a time and don\'t try to do everything at once. You already know in your gut where the most important changes need to be made. ', 'Spirituality': u"Trust the wisdom of your body and of your higher power/the universe when the reversed 7 of Swords appears in the context of a health question. If you think you need more rest, then rest, even if you just got back from a two week vacation! If you feel the urge to talk to someone about your health concerns then do so. At the same time, don't hesitate to get second or third opinions when it comes to invasive procedures. ", 'Health': u' As with the upright 7, the appearance of the reversed 7 of Swords in the context of work, can mean that your employer is looking at your work and what you do very closely. This is not a time to try to "get away" with anything whatsoever; you will surely be found out. Something which seems very small to you (like taking home a few pens from work) may seem like a huge breach of trust and result in major problems at work with your boss, up to and including the possible loss of your job. If you are looking for work, play up your trustworthiness and willingness to commit. ', 'Finances': u' This is a good time to keep your own counsel when it comes to your spiritual beliefs. You can associate with others without believing everything they believe, of course. However, if you keep an open mind and open eyes and ears, you can receive spiritual wisdom now from people (and from the universe) whether or not you are really trying to do so. Inspiration can come in a nanosecond sometimes.

Try to get to the root of any problems; arguments are not always about what they seem to be about on the surface. If you are feeling lonely and looking for love, this card is a hint that you have some work to do on yourself first. Another person cannot fill you up, if you are feeling empty. And feeling empty drives prospective partners away. ', 'Name': u'8 Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u' In general, the Reversed 8 of Swords tells us that although it is time to move forward, that we cannot plan or be utterly prepared for everything in life that might happen, and that accepting that fact is an important part of adulthood. Know that when we need help, help is always available. Take one step at at time. Worry solves and changes nothing. ', 'Spirituality': u" When you see the reversed 8 of Swords in the context of a health question, it points to things not being clear with the physical body. This is a very important time to pay attention to any symptoms that you might be having, and is also a very important time to seek advice from a qualified medical professional. Self-treatment when this card appears is not advisable. You need to know exactly what you are dealing with. Still, don't panic. Just have a check-up. ", 'Health': u' If you would like to make a change in your work, the reversed 8 of Swords lets you know that this is possible, but that patience and deliberate steps forward are going to be needed. Be open and aware for chance meetings which could help you in your career and any hoped for changes. Everyone may not understand or support your wishes to make a change. Know that you must do what is best for you. ', 'Finances': u' In order for your spirituality and your peacefulness in this moment to be on the upswing, it is possible that you need to re-examine your past when the reversed 8 of Swords appears. There may be an incident or trauma from the past which you have not fully dealt with and resolved. Think back, and see if there is something that you need to work through.

If you feel that your partner is or has been dishonest, this is a good time to check into it. If you're looking for love, take your time when getting to know new people now.

These new people may not be who they seem to be. Use caution and reasonable doubt when signing anything, and when it comes to business deals. Slow down.\r ', 'Spirituality': u' With the reversed 9 appears in the context of health, this is no time to be embarrassed or timid about your body. If something is concerning you about your health, talk to your doctor about it in no uncertain terms. The help you need is available. You just have to go after it.

Do the best you can, and don't be timid if you feel that someone in your workplace is not treating you fairly or has taken credit for your work in some way. If you are looking for work, you will not help your case by holding back. Speak up for yourself and your talents.

However, more work may be needed if this relationship is to survive.  Remember that any relationship takes two; problems are almost never entirely the fault of one party. If you are looking for love, it's possible that you think that you are more ready for a long term commitment than you actually are. Give this some deep thought. You don't have to conform to society's expectations - unless they are truly right for you.

This doesn't have to be the end of the world (or the end of your job) but ignoring these problems will not make them go away. You have reached the point where you can now see what is best for you, your thinking is clearer. Take some quiet time to decide what your next moves are. Is it really best for you to stay where you are? If looking for work, you may be looking in the wrong places. Rethink.

Unexpected occurrences are part of life and you shouldn't beat yourself up because of them. Work through any problems that crop up one step at a time.

Before agreeing to major, invasive health procedures, seek a second opinion if at all possible. Don't share health information that you want to be kept private, particularly with someone you don' t know well. They are unlikely to keep your secret.

If you sense this, ask.

Be cautious about sharing information in any form; emails are generally not secure and nearly any telephone conversation can be overheard or recorded. No need to be paranoid, but there is a need to be prudent.

Be sure that you have a paper trail and backups to prove you have been doing things the correct way. Someone may also try to blame you for a problem that wasn't your fault. Stand up tall and protect yourself. This would be a good time to polish your resume and do background tasks, rather than actively seeking work.

Protect yourself, and also do not accept dishonesty from him, "man\'s man," or not.', 'Name': u'King Of Swords Reversed', 'General': u" In general, the King of Swords reversed points to very forceful energy, whether or not he represents a literal man in your life.

If you are looking for work, as with the upright meaning, a man, likely to be dark haired and the stereotypical "man\'s man" may be in a position to hire you, but you will have to impress him on every level to get the job.

If you\'re wondering if your job may be eliminated, unfortunately, when this card appears, the answer can be yes. Forewarned is forearmed. If that happens, what will you do about it?', 'Finances': u' You may not be very inclined to discipline yourself now, but even so, now is a time that discipline will help you meet your spiritual goals.

All in all, things will be looking up professionally. ', 'Finances': u' You are suddenly likely to be spiritually hungry when the Queen of Wands appears. There\'s nothing wrong with that, but don\'t get carried away thinking you\'ve suddenly found "THE" total answer you\'ve been looking for your entire life and sell everything you own, for example, to join a spiritual group in another country.

Think positively.', 'Spirituality': u' The King of Wands is rich with vitality. However, he also carries a warning not to overdo things or push your body further than it is able to go; rest and recuperation is also a critical part of health.

Allow yourself to feel what you feel, but let those feelings go in a positive way.', 'Health': u" In the context of work the King of Wands can indicate a man with hair on the lighter end of the spectrum who wants to serve as a mentor for you. This is a man who you can trust and can count on, although to a degree his people skills can be a bit rough around the edges. Learn what you can from him but pay attention to the places where you wish to conduct yourself differently from the way he does things. Overall, things should be going well work-wise and if you're looking for employment, the King is a very positive significator that a position that you'd be pleased with is likely to be forthcoming soon.", 'Finances': u" The King of Wands is a sign that you are already well on your way with regard to spiritual exploration. However, it also warns of a slight tendency to perhaps get carried away and to try to push too far, too fast. Developing spirituality is a process, not an overnight sensation. Give yourself time and space to just be. If sitting still and meditating is difficult for you, that points to an even more urgent need to make time and efforts to do it.

You may benefit by talking to someone new about the way that they handle such things; this could be very inspirational. ', 'Spirituality': u' The reversed Ace of Wands points to a need to watch out for--and limit or stop--indulgences. Being moderate in your habits now is very important.

(If this were to be the case you would already be feeling this pain before the reading is cast.) If you are in pain, these are not signals to ignore or to let your health care practitioner ignore, even if there is no clear reason for the pain that has been found yet.

Are you eating extremely well? Are you drinking pure, clean water? Thinking positively? All that "boring, normal stuff," especially in the face of illness, can make a tremendous positive difference. You may get conflicting information about your health from professionals, never hesitate to ask for and/or get a second or even third opinion if necessary.

', 'Finances': u' The reversed 6 of Wands can indicate that you are somehow expecting the universe to give you answers or guidance without any input or effort from you. Yes, it sometimes happens that way, but more often, we are expected to ask about specifics, and take action on our own, rather than waiting for everything to line up in perfect order. Be open to the insights you are given from others, at least enough to consider them fully even if you ultimately reject their interpretation.', 'ID': 148}, 149: {'Love': u' In a committed relationship, the 7 of Wands reversed can indicate that one or both of you is being indecisive about something. This is usually because of one of two things: either the fear is too intense to move forward, or the time is simply not right. Something can be done about the former, generally speaking. If you are looking for love, the first thing to do is to get outside your front door. Get out, have fun, and see where life takes you. Thinking for too long about the exact specifics of the "perfect partner" for you is counterproductive--there\'s no such person. ', 'Name': u'7 Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u" The reversed 7 of Wands can point to a feeling of anxiety. If you are feeling anxious, try to get to the root of why you might be feeling this way, and what you can do to make a difference. Sometimes anxiety is alleviated by taking action. If you need help dealing with your feelings or with taking action, don't be too proud to admit it. ", 'Spirituality': u" When the 7 of Wands reversed appears in a health reading, anxiety can be the biggest problem that you are facing. That doesn't mean to ignore your physical symptoms, but it does mean that it's important to understand the mind body connection. Get your symptoms checked out, and if you're given a clean bill of health by a trustworthy medical professional, then it's time to consider your thoughts and your spirituality, if you continue to have problems. ", 'Health': u' You may be at a loss about what to do with regard to your work situation if you are already employed. If that\'s the case, talk to someone you trust, seek out the advice of others who have experienced similar situations. The answers are out there. If you are looking for work, try to "think outside the box." Who could you contact for work that you hadn\'t considered talking to yet? ', 'Finances': u" If you aren't careful when the reversed 7 of Wands appears in a reading about spirituality, you could be tempted to talk and talk (and listen to others talk and talk) about spirituality. Your best bet is actually not to do that; your best bet is to be quiet and listen to the universe, and see what comes to you now. Silence can be healing. Be still.", 'ID': 149}, 150: {'Love': u' In the context of love, when the 8 of Wands reversed appears, you may need to watch out for pangs of jealousy, whether in an existing committed love relationship or in a relationship that you are just hopeful about. Jealousy gets you nowhere and is not proof of love. Be self-posessed and self-sufficient. ', 'Name': u'8 Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u" You may be feeling guilty about something when you receive the reversed 8 of Wands. Remember that there is nothing that can be changed about the past; the only good thing that guilt can create is a change in future behavior. Sometimes the best thing to do is to forgive yourself. But your conscience is there for a reason. Don't ignore it. ", 'Spirituality': u" Again, when the 8 of Wands reversed appears in a health question, patience and calmness is necessary. You will not help your health status by being overly anxious or fearful. Send your body loving and healing energy, no matter what the potential problems in your body might be. Don't fear the worst, and don't suffer over health problems which may not ever happen. ", 'Health': u' There may be disagreements and arguments at work when this card appears. You and/or the people you work with have put too much effort into things to let relatively petty issues derail major issues. Back off, cool down, and rethink. If you are looking for work, unfortunately there may be a delay in a decision you have been waiting on. Be patient and trust that things will work out the way they should. ', 'Finances': u' The 8 of Wands reversed calls for focus, determination, and cooperation on every level, including your spiritual outlook. It is easy for energy to dissipate now. Ground yourself as best you can and try to make time for meditation, stillness, and contemplation. You cannot do all things at once or be all things to all people. No one can.', 'ID': 150}, 151: {'Love': u" You may be 100% convinced that you are right and your partner is wrong about something when the reversed 9 of Wands appears in the context of love. That may indeed be the case, but you are not going to force your partner to see your point of view through anger and coercion. Try a gentle approach, and find out what underlies your partner's point of view or actions. If you are looking for love, again, a gentle, thoughtful approach can work wonders. Hot and fast pursuit is likely to get you burned now. ", 'Name': u'9 Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u' When the 9 of Wands reversed comes up, it is important not to "beat yourself up," if you find your mental, emotional, or physical strength waning. None of us can be perfectly strong all the time. Allow yourself to lean on someone or something positive, and know that your strength will return. Everything is a cycle. ', 'Spirituality': u" Do the best you can to stay calm and patient. Anxiety can be a major problem now if you let it overwhelm you. Deep breathing, vigorous exercise (if you can tolerate it/if your doctor has okayed it) can be very helpful now. If you're waiting for answers on health questions, you may have to wait just a little longer. Don't hesitate to seek support and talk about what is concerning you. Release tension as best you can. ", 'Health': u' You may be feeling absolutely overwhelmed at work and be unsure about where to turn. If this is the case, talk it through with people in your personal life that you trust, and then consider what the appropriate action would be in your workplace. There is no need to be a bull in a china shop, but there is also usually little sense in doing multiple things halfway rather than a few things very well at work. If possible, ask for help. Take one hour at a time, if you need to. ', 'Finances': u' You may not be feeling very "spiritual" when the reversed 9 of Wands appears. You may feel that there are too many functional concerns in your life right now to give much attention to your spirit. That would be a mistake, as we are at all times a mixture of body, mind, and spirit, and the people who are the happiest and function the best typically are mindful of all three parts of that triad. Even if all you can muster now is a few moments in silent contemplation or a visit to a house of worship once every few weeks, that\'s a start. Start where you are. Some attention to your spirit is better than nothing at all, and it\'s more than okay to handle your spirituality in your own way, no matter what anyone else says or thinks.', 'ID': 151}, 152: {'Love': u' As with the upright meaning, the appearance of the 10 of Wands reversed usually signifies difficulty in an existing relationship. It may be time (or past time) that both of you lay all the cards on the table and really talk about the relationship. There is a slight possibility when this card appears that you are actually being misled or that there is infidelity involved when this card appears. Consider whether there have been changes in behavior etc., that may point to this or to other untruths that need to be faced in order for the relationship to either work on a more honest level, or to end. Hiding from the truth serves no one. ', 'Name': u'10 Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u' When the 10 of Wands appears reversed, you may be tired, dealing with delays, and feeling overstretched. This is not necessarily something that you need to push through. You may be far better served by taking a break. Even a short few hours to relax and de-stress can be helpful. Seek out upbeat people.', 'Spirituality': u' If you have not been feeling well when this card appears, first give some thought to whether some or all of your symptoms could be a result of stress. You are likely to have been pushing yourself too hard for far too long. However, if in doubt, give yourself the peace of mind of obtaining a thorough medical check-up. Even if money is an issue, there are health care services available in most communities in some form if you know where to look. Ask around.', 'Health': u" The reversed 10 of Wands is a hint that you may be best served by seeking a new employment situation if you are currently working and unhappy in your job situation. You may literally be being mistreated, and even in a tight job market, you don't have to stand for that. Take things one moment at a time, and think through what has been happening. Don't take injustice personally, but don't feel that you have to put up with it forever, either. The best solution may simply be to leave.", 'Finances': u" When this card appears it's critical to realize that you have a duty to protect yourself; physically, spiritually, and emotionally. If you have been treated badly by anyone, repeatedly, whether it is your boss, your children, or your best friend, it is now past time to either address the situation or to end the relationship. You are your own best advocate, no one can (or should) do it for you.", 'ID': 152}, 153: {'Love': u' When the reversed Page of Wands appears in a love context, the focus may be on getting to know each other better, trading stories, etc, rather than on an immediate, serious commitment. You are well advised not to push if you are currently seeing someone but are not yet committed - the time may not yet be right. If you are looking for love, someone may warn you away from a new interest; make up your own mind. Gossip and "warnings" aren\'t always true - but usually shouldn\'t be completely ignored, either. ', 'Name': u'Page Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u' Occasionally the reversed Page of Wands can depict unwelcome news that may be coming soon. This is not usually anything horrendous or dire, just something that you would rather not have happened. More often it indicates a need for focus and decisiveness. ', 'Spirituality': u" In terms of health the reversed Page points to people nearby who are ready, willing, and able, to be helpful to you in terms of your health. This can be professionals, or simply an inspirational exercise buddy or friend. Don't try to do everything on your own. This card shows you'll get farther being open to the understandings, good influences, and expertise of others. ", 'Health': u" In terms of work, the  Page of Wands reversed can show a woman (likely to have hair on the lighter end of the spectrum) who may be causing complications at work because of her indecisiveness. It's possible that you are standing in your own way through your own difficulty with making a decision. If you are looking for work, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Hiring decisions may also be delayed a little longer. ", 'Finances': u' The Page definitely points to a need to honor and listen to your own intuition. Creativity may go far to enrich your spiritual experiences now. Someone that you already know may have some important spiritual insights to share. Even if you\'re usually very private about such things, consider talking to a friend or two about their spiritual "take" or experiences. This can be unbelievably inspirational.', 'ID': 153}, 154: {'Love': u' The Knight of Wands reversed can indicate stress and minor arguments in an existing relationship. Try to get to the bottom of what is really happening. An argument about the toaster isn\'t usually really about the toaster! If you are looking for love, it\'s possible that you think you may have found "the one" and a permanent commitment may even come about. Be as sure as it is possible to be that you know what you are getting into before you "tie the knot." You could be rushing things. ', 'Name': u'Knight Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u' Knights are often a sign that you are about to get a message, whether they show up in a reading reversed or upright. Unfortunately though, if you are using the reversals for interpretation, the Knight of Wands in reverse can signify that the message will be along the lines of "There will be a delay, you will have to wait." If so, try to wait patiently. This Knight means what he says. ', 'Spirituality': u' This is not a time to overdo it with regard to exercise or new health regimens. Yes, you must support your health, but you don\'t want to sabotage yourself by going overboard. Be honest with, and get advice from, medical professionals that you trust before undertaking a new, strict regimen, whether that\'s with diet, exercise, or simply with taking several new supplements. You don\'t have to be "perfect" to be healthy. ', 'Health': u" There may be some sort of interruption with work. For example, you may be pulled away from the work you prefer to attend some sort of training or meeting. Or the building you work in may literally be shut down for a few days. Try to take this with as good an attitude as you can muster. If you are looking for work, hiring decisions may be delayed. Don't worry too much - it won't help. ", 'Finances': u' When the Knight of Wands reversed appears, you may suddenly decide to end a long term spiritual practice or leave your spiritual community. This is not a decision to make lightly, of course, and there may well be many friends or family members who will not take it well or who will not understand. Still, the bottom line is that it is your spirit and your life, and if a spiritual tradition no longer "works" for you, there is no sense whatsoever in pretending that it does. This change doesn\'t have to happen all at once, you can gradually withdraw, if necessary. You will replace this with something that works better for you, even if that "something" is a fairly solitary contemplation.', 'ID': 154}, 155: {'Love': u' With regard to love, an older, light-haired woman could be involved indirectly in  your relationship. If she is your "mother in law," do your best to make her an ally, regardless of how you feel about her. If you are looking for love, you could well meet a very interesting potential partner through an older woman. Let the women in your life know if you are looking to meet someone new.', 'Name': u'Queen Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u" In general, the Queen of Wands reversed can indicate that there may soon be a need for you to help out others who are having a problem of some kind. It could also be that an older woman would like to help you with a situation that you are facing, but for some reason she is unable to do so. Still, her moral support will be helpful. If you are facing a difficult situation, reach out.\n\nWork: When the reversed Queen of Wands appears in a reading about work, there may shortly be frustrating obstacles and delays that you will be up against. It's important to not take these personally; just work through them one moment at a time. There may be an older, light haired woman in the workplace (or who is in the position of hiring, if you are looking for work) who is throwing up obstacles. Don't get frustrated about it, just show her the rational reasons why she needs to do things your way (or hire you.) Do this and you could be more successful than you imagine. ", 'Spirituality': u' The Queen of Wands reversed generally refers to strong basic health and a positive basic underlying health status. If you are not feeling well, a female health care practitioner may have very important and helpful advice for you. The Queen of Wands is generally linked to fertility; however if you draw this card in the context of having been trying to conceive a child without success, it shows that you should not give up but that the time may have come to seek outside counsel, as in seeing your doctor and discussing your concerns and efforts. Try to relax.', 'Health': u'When the Queen of Wands appears in a reading about work, you are going to get a great deal accomplished successfully in a short period of time - this is a very positive omen. If you are looking for work, this Queen can mean that a woman (usually with light-colored hair) will be instrumental in helping you find employment. All in all, things will be looking up professionally. ', 'Finances': u" A convincing, and perhaps domineering, older woman may try to convince you that she has all or many of the answers when it comes to spirituality. You may need to draw boundaries with her several times, in order to not be pulled into something that works for her but which you have no interest in. She may be angry or hurt as a result, but remember that no one has the right to tell you how to live your spiritual life. It's important to think and experience for yourself.", 'ID': 155}, 156: {'Love': u" The King of Wands reversed is a good omen with regard to love, especially if you are interested in an older man who is energetic, kind, and warm. Regardless of who you are interested in or involved with, this card indicates though that your beloved may need some time to think through what he or she needs and what they want to happen in your relationship. It's important that you be patient and open while they figure it out. Take one step at a time. ", 'Name': u'King Of Wands Reversed', 'General': u' In general the King of Wands reversed is a positive card. People around you are likely to be kind, tolerant, and understanding. You should have more than enough energy to get what you need to do accomplished. Again, a light haired, older man may play an important and helpful role in your life. ', 'Spirituality': u' The King of Wands reversed definitely points to strong physical health. You may benefit immensely from a session with a physical trainer or nutritional counselor now provided you are open to hearing what they have to say and acting upon it. If you have new-found health goals, be sure not to push yourself too hard and risk injury. Slow and steady is the way to go. ', 'Health': u' In the context of work the reversed King of Wands generally indicates helpful men, but it can also signify that one man in particular may tend to be condescending and patronizing toward you. Depending on the situation you may need to accept a certain amount of this, however if this man creates too much difficulty or becomes fully inappropriate toward you there may need to be a confrontation or action taken about it. You do not have to accept a hostile or fully inappropriate work situation. However, neither should you allow yourself to be too thin-skinned. ', 'Finances': u" The King of Wands , whether reversed or upright, is a sign that you are already well on your way with regard to spiritual exploration. Know that you don't have to deny yourself the entire world in order to grow spiritually; we are put here on this abundant planet, with other people, for a reason. Plenty and Joy can be spiritual experiences just as surely as denial and austerity can be. And the first two are certainly much more fun! Relax a little, and you may find your spiritual growth happening faster.", 'ID': 156}}
